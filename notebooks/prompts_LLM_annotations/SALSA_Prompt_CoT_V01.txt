You are an expert text simplification analyst using the SALSA framework for a research project. 
Your task is to analyze the differences between an original sentence and its simplified version. Utmost careful work is paramount here.

You are first given some information on the SALSA Framework for Text Simplification Annotations:
<SALSA_Information>
The SALSA (Structured Annotation for Linguistic Simplification Analysis) Framework is a comprehensive method for evaluating text simplifications. 
It provides a structured approach to annotating and analyzing changes made between an original text and its simplified version.

SALSA recognizes 6 primary types of edits:
Deletion, Insertion, Substitution, Splitting, Reordering, and Structural Changes.

- Deletion:
       - Insignificant Deletion: Did it remove INSIGNIFICANT information (thus improving the sentence)? Example: "Like so many hyped books before it, The Midnight Library excited me and gave me pause." → "The Midnight Library excited me and gave me pause."
       - Trivial Deletion: Was it a trivial deletion?
       - Significant Deletion: Did it remove SIGNIFICANT information (deleting necessary and relevant content to the sentence's central meaning)? Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." (Removing "volatile organic")
   - Insertion:
        Positive Insertions:
        - Elaboration: Adds meaningful, relevant, and correct information. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing..." → "Many volatile organic chemicals, which harm our environment, are increasing..."
        - Trivial Insertion: Adds minor modifications that don't significantly affect meaning or complexity. Example: "How big is the family you cook for?" → "How big is the family THAT you cook for?"
        Negative Insertions:
        - Repetition: Adds information that simply repeats knowledge already contained in the sentence. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals, which are chemicals, are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere."
        - Irrelevant: Adds information unrelated to the main idea of the sentence. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing..." → "Many volatile organic chemicals, unlike low vapor pressure chemicals, are increasing..."
        - Contradiction: Adds information that contradicts the original sentence. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing..." → "Many volatile organic chemicals, which are decreasing in our troposphere, are increasing..."
        - Factual Error: Introduces externally verifiable incorrect information. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere when they decide to."

   - Substitution (Attention: Differing sub-types depending on the type of substitution):
        - same meaning:  Swaps complex words with equivalent, simpler alternatives, while retaining the same meaning. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals are being seen more in the lower troposphere."
        - less information: Deleting insignificant information (good), trivial information, or significant information (bad). Example: Like Deletion
        - more information: --> refer to Insertion types (Elaboration, etc). Example: Like Insertion.
        - different information: information was removed from the phrase and replaced with new information. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals are decreasing in abundance in the lower troposphere."

   - Splitting (subdiving a sentence into smaller sentencens).
        - Negative Splitting: Split at an inappropriate location or interrupted the flow of idea. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing. They are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere."
        - Neutral Splitting: Divides the sentence without significantly affecting readability or meaning
        - Positive Splitting: Improves clarity by separating independent pieces of information into distinct sentences. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing. They are found in abundance in the lower troposphere."

   - Reordering:
        - Word-level Reorder: Reorganizes modifiers within a phrase
            - Negative: Presented a new word order with less clarity within a clause
            - Neutral: Reorders words without significantly affecting clarity or meaning
            - Positive: Presents a new word order that improves clarity within a clause. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "Many organic volatile chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere."
        - Component-level Reorder: Moves clauses or content across a sentence
            - Negative: Presents a new clausal order that reduces clarity or disrupts the logical flow of ideas
            - Neutral: Reorders components without significantly affecting clarity or meaning
            - Positive: Presents a new clausal order that improves clarity or the logical flow of ideas. Example: "Many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance in the lower troposphere." → "In the lower troposphere, many volatile organic chemicals are increasing in abundance."

   - Structural: 
        - Voice Change: Changes between active and passive voice. Example: "Elevation is not primarily considered by the system." → "The system does not primarily consider elevation."
        - Part-of-Speech Change: Modifies words' derivation or inflection. Example: "The ability to capture nature scenes has been improving..." → "The ability to capture nature scenes has seen improvement..." Additional example: "The protesters turned violent when..." → "The violent protesters..."
        - Tense Change: Modifies verb modality or tense. "The governor told reporters he had overseen a productive conversation." → "The governor oversaw a productive conversation."
        - Grammatical Number Change: Changes between singular and plural or generic and specific. Example: "Victor had scored that goal against the US in 2011, and another in 2012." → "Victor had scored those goals in 2011 and 2012."
        - Clausal Change: Modifies predicate structure. Example: "Donaldson attempted to speak clearly and he was successful." → "Donaldson attempted to speak clearly and successfully." Additional example: "Although it was raining outside, Jobs continued work in his garage." → "Outside it was raining and Jobs continued work in his garage."

For each edit, we rate its severity as a number from 1 to 3:
   Severity levels for negative changes:
    - 1: minor (changes, but sentence retains central meaning)
    - 2: somewhat (significant changes, but sentence retains central meaning)
    - 3: a lot (significant changes, changing or removing the sentence's central meaning or information)
    Severity levels for positive changes:
    - 1: minor (slight improvement in readibility/understandability)
    - 2: somewhat (some improvement in improving a sentence's understandability)
    - 3: a lot (significant changes in improving a sentence's understandability, while retaining it's core meaning)

In conclusion, the SALSA Framework offers a comprehensive and structured approach to analyzing text simplifications. 
By breaking down edits into specific categories (Deletion, Insertion, Substitution, Reordering, Splitting, and Structural Change) and assessing their impact on information content and readability, 
it provides a powerful tool for evaluating and improving simplification efforts.

Now with this knowledge, follow these steps carefully:

<instructions>
1. Input: You will be presented with two sentences:
<original_sentence>
{{ORIGINAL_SENTENCE}}
</original_sentence>

<simplified_sentence>
{{SIMPLIFIED_SENTENCE}}
</simplified_sentence>

2. Identify Changes:
List all changes you observe between the original and simplified sentences. 
For each change, specify the affected words (using their indexes) 
Important: You are given an index map of the words, indicating the position of each word. Use the numeric indices to mark which words are affected by an edit.
List them all (including their indices) in a <identified_changes> section.
Important: Try to avoid overlapping edits, meaning a given word should ideally only be present in one identified edit and edits should not overlap.
And try to keep an edit to its smallest possible size (e.g., splitting up bigger edits into their components when sensible instead of marking half of a sentence as one big edit).

3. Categorize Changes:
For each change you identified, categorize it according to the SALSA framework. 
Determine if it's a Deletion, Insertion, Substitution, Reordering, Splitting, or Structural change. 
List them all in a <categorized_changes> section.

4. Analyze Impact and rate Severity:
For each categorized change, analyze its impact and severity.
First, determine if it's positive, neutral, or negative according to the SALSA framework criteria and rate the severity of each change on a scale of 1-3, where 1 is low impact and 3 is high impact. Justify each rating based on the SALSA framework guidelines.
List them all in a <rating_changes> section.

5. Detect Errors:
Examine the simplified sentence for any potential errors, such as coreference issues or grammar and fluency problems. 
List any errors you find in a <errors> section.

6. Generate JSON Structure:
Based on your analysis and all the information you created, create a JSON structure that follows the format of the examples supplied below. 
Only fill out the "edits" section of it (no need to re-state the source and target sentences, and the metadata).
Put this into a <JSON_OUTPUT> section.

7. Review and Refine:
Review the JSON structure you've created. Ensure all changes are accurately represented and all required fields are present. 
Try avoiding overlapping edits.
Use the examples below and the SALSA guidelines as help. Make any necessary adjustments.
</instructions>

Example output JSON files:
<examples>
<TODO INSERT EXAMPLE>
</examples>

Remember to be thorough in your analysis and think step by step. Verify your JSON file at the end, to validate its properly formatted or change it if necessary.
