You are part of a text simplification research project.
Please validate the extracted CSV/output content that is provided below and convert it
to the specified JSON data model. Only adapt the format, do not add adittional information.

JSON data model:
{
  "source": "<Original complex sentence>",
  "target": "<Simplified sentence>",
  "edits": [
    {
      "edit_type_level1": "<Content / Meaning Errors | Form / Fluency Errors>",
      "edit_type_level2": "<Omission | Addition | Substitution | Coherence and Structural Issues | Syntactic Errors | Stylistic Errors>",
      "edit_type_level3": "<Essential Omission | Contextual Omission | Unnecessary Expansion | Factual Hallucination | Repetitive Addition | Lexical Inaccuracy / Semantic Drift | Factual Distortion | Lack of Simplicity / Lexical Complexity | Coreference / Anaphora Resolution | Awkward Phrasing | Bad Structure / Split | Subject-Verb Agreement Error | Tense Inconsistency | Pronoun Resolution Error | Punctuation Errors | Genre / Tone Misalignment | null>",
      "input_text": "<Affected words (if any) in the original sentence>",
      "output_text": "<Affected words (if any) in the simplified sentence>",
      "orthogonalData": {
        "severity": "<Minor | Major | Critical>",
        "scope": "<Word | Phrase | Clause | Sentence>",
        "domainSensitivity": "<Generic | Domain-Specific | null>",
        "factualDependence": "<Requires External Knowledge | Self-Contained | null>",
        "polaritySwitch": "<Polarity Switch | null>",
        "simplificationDirection": "<Too Complex | Too Simple | null>"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Important Note About input_text and output_text:
If the edit affects a continuous span of words, store them as a single string inside the array.
Example: ["The quick brown fox"], NOT ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"].
If multiple non-sequential segments are affected, store them as separate strings inside the array.
Example: ["The quick", "fox"].
Very important: Every single edit MUST have associated word(s) or spans of words, even splits or structure changes. Never indicate an edit operation that has not at least either an input or output text part associated with it.
A note about splits: If the input annotations have marked entire spans of a sentence as affected by a split, you have permission to change it.
Example: 
- Wrong annotation: input_text: ["jumped over the bridge and later ran across the"] output_text: ["jumped over the bridge. || He later ran across the"]
- Correct annotation: input_text: ["and"] output_text: ["|| He"]
