"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) occurs when the brain ventricles expand, causing a triad of gait, cognitive, and urinary impairment.","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a medical condition where normal fluid‐filled brain structures (ventricles) slowly become larger over time (hydrocephalus), and the surrounding brain structures slowly change to adjust to this. Eventually, the critical brain structures become affected, causing symptoms such as difficulty walking, thinking, and with bladder control. ","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) happens when the brain ventricles grow larger. This causes problems with walking, thinking, and urinating."
"It can occur after a clear brain injury such as trauma, but can also occur without a clear cause (termed idiopathic, or iNPH). ","Sometimes there is a clear reason for the ventricles getting larger, for example after a head injury, where blood can 'clog‐up' the ventricles. However, in older adults (over 60 years), NPH develops with no clear cause, known as 'idiopathic' normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). ","It can happen after a clear brain injury like trauma or without a clear cause, called idiopathic or iNPH."
"Non‐randomised studies have shown a benefit from surgically diverting ventricular fluid to an area of lower pressure by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐shunting in iNPH, but historically there have been limited randomised controlled trial (RCT) data to confirm this. ","There have been reports of patients with iNPH getting better when an operation is performed where a tube is inserted into the brain or spinal canal to move the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to an area of lower pressure such as the abdominal cavity or right atrium of the heart (CSF‐shunting). However, most of the evidence to support the use of CSF‐shunting has been of low quality, and people having CSF‐shunting were not directly compared with control groups who did not have CSF‐shunting","Non-randomized studies have shown that CSF-shunting surgery benefits iNPH, but there have been few randomized controlled trials to confirm this."
