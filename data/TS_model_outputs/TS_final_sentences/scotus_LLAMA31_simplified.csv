"To determine whether Corner Post’s APA claim is timely, the Court must interpret §2401(a), which provides that civil actions against the United States “shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.”","To determine if Corner Post's lawsuit is on time, the Court needs to understand §2401(a). It says lawsuits against the US are blocked unless they're filed within six years."
"While the Board argues that §2401(a) should not be interpreted to adopt a “challenger-by-challenger” approach, the standard accrual rule that §2401(a) exemplifies is plaintiff specific.","The Board says §2401(a) shouldn't be applied in separate cases, but it applies to each case individually."
"Importantly, contemporaneous dictionaries also explained that a cause of action accrues ""on [the] date that damage is sustained and not [the] date when causes are set in motion which ultimately produce injury.""",A cause of action accrues on the date of the injury.
"The Board leaves open the possibility that someone could bring an asapplied challenge to a rule when the agency relies on that rule in enforcement proceedings against that person, even if more than six years have passed since the rule’s promulgation.",The Board says someone might still challenge a rule after it's been enforced for over six years.
"The APA provisions grant Corner Post a cause of action subject to certain conditions, and §2401(a) sets the window within which Corner Post can assert its claim.","The APA provisions allow Corner Post to sue, but only under certain conditions."
Statutes of limitations ‘require plaintiffs to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims’; statutes of repose reflect a ‘legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.’,Statutes of limitations require plaintiffs to pursue claims quickly. Statutes of repose let defendants be free from liability after a certain time has passed.
"The Board’s interpretation would thereby decouple the statute of limitations from any injury ‘such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit’—for some, but not all, suits governed by §2401(a).","For some lawsuits, but not all, the time limit starts when the person was hurt."
The Board’s arguments to the contrary lack merit.,The Board's arguments don't make sense.
Departing from the traditional rule is particularly inappropriate here because contemporaneous statutes demonstrate that Congress in 1948 knew how to create a limitations period that begins with the defendant’s action instead of the plaintiff’s injury.,"Congress created special rules for 1948, and they started counting time when the person who was sued did something wrong."
"While §702 equips injured parties with a cause of action, §704 limits the agency actions that are subject to judicial review.","While §702 gives injured parties a cause of action, §704 limits which agency actions can be reviewed by courts."
This traditional rule constitutes a strong background presumption.,This tradition is generally assumed.
"Notwithstanding Crown Coat’s holding, the Board and the dissent try to marshal support from its dicta.","Despite Crown Coat’s opinion being ignored, the Board and the dissent are still trying to find support."
"Absent vacatur, the remedy for a regulated plaintiff would not automatically extend to other regulated parties.","Absent vacatur, the remedy for one party would not automatically apply to others."
The Government’s current position on vacatur would de facto overrule Abbott Laboratories as to suits by unregulated parties.,The government's current position would effectively cancel the previous ruling in the Abbott Laboratories case for suits brought by non-regulated parties.
"To decide the facial challenges here, the courts below must explore the laws’ full range of applications—the constitutionally impermissible and permissible both—and compare the two sets.","The courts need to consider all possible applications of the law, both allowed and not allowed under the constitution, and compare them."
But that conclusion would rest on a serious misunderstanding of First Amendment precedent and principle.,But that conclusion would be based on a mistaken understanding of free speech laws.
That controversy sounds a familiar note: We have repeatedly faced the question whether ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the First Amendment.,Requiring a party to host someone else's views raises a familiar issue: Does that implicate the First Amendment?
"The Court has repeatedly held that ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the First Amendment if, though only if, the regulated party is engaged in its own expressive activity, which the mandated access would alter or disrupt.",The Court has said that forcing one party to give space to another person's views can be a First Amendment issue if it interferes with the first party's own activities.
"From that slew of individual cases, three general points emerge.",Three main points can be seen.
"First, the First Amendment offers protection when an entity engaged
in compiling and curating others’ speech into an expressive product of
its own is directed to accommodate messages it would prefer to exclude.","When a company compiles and organizes someone else's words into its own work, the First Amendment protects it."
"The next order of business is to decide which of the laws’ applications
violate the First Amendment, and to measure them against the rest.","We need to identify which of these laws conflict with the First Amendment and compare them to others.""."
"To ensure “the free exchange of ideas and information,” H. B. 20 requires regulated platforms to abide by the following content-moderation and disclosure requirements.","To ensure that people can share their ideas freely, regulated platforms must follow certain rules about what they allow on their sites and who is responsible for it."
"However, the law allows platforms to censor speech that: federal law “specifically authorize[s]” them to censor; speech that the platform is told sexually exploits children or survivors of sexual abuse; speech that “directly incites criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group because of race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, sex or status as peace officer or judge”; and speech that is otherwise unlawful or has been the subject of a user’s request for removal from his or her feed or profile.","The law lets platforms remove speech that breaks federal rules, helps sexual abuse, directly asks people to hurt others, or threatens violence because of someone's race or background. It also lets them take down speech that's requested by a user or is otherwise against the law."
"NetChoice contends that the Florida and Texas statutes facially violate the First Amendment, meaning that they cannot be applied to anyone at any time under any circumstances without violating the Constitution",They say these laws directly contradict the First Amendment.
"Represented by sophisticated counsel, NetChoice made the deliberate choice to mount a facial challenge to both laws, and in doing so, it obviously knew what it would have to show in order to prevail.","NetChoice chose to challenge both laws, knowing what evidence was needed to win."
The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.,The reasons why the President can't be prosecuted don't apply when he's working with Congress.
"Appreciating the “unique risks” that arise when the President’s energies are diverted by proceedings that might render him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties,” the Court has recognized Presidential immunities and privileges “rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.","The Court recognizes special protections for the President, who must stay focused on his job."
"In Fitzgerald, for instance, the Court concluded that a former Presi dent is entitled to absolute immunity from “damages liability for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility.”",The court said a former president can't be sued for actions taken while in office.
"And he contended that a President has absolute immunity from crimi nal prosecution for actions performed within the outer pe rimeter of his official responsibilities, to ensure that he can undertake the especially sensitive duties of his office with bold and unhesitating action.",He believed that a President should be completely protected from being sued or punished for things he does as part of his job.
"We conclude that under our constitutional structure of
separated powers, the nature of Presidential power re-
quires that a former President have some immunity from
criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in
office.",The former President should be immune from prosecution for official actions done while in office.
"Following the analysis set forth in Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, and Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412, this action implicates the Sev enth Amendment because the SEC’s antifraud provisions replicate common law fraud.",This action involves a Seventh Amendment issue because it's similar to a common law lawsuit about fraud.
"To determine whether a suit is legal in nature, courts must consider whether the cause of action resembles common law causes of action, and whether the remedy is the sort that was traditionally obtained in a court of law.",Courts decide if a lawsuit is legitimate by seeing how it compares to previous lawsuits and whether its solution is one that would typically be decided in court.
"On that basis, this Court has repeatedly explained that matters concerning private rights may not be removed from Article III courts.","Based on this, the Court has said many times that issues related to personal rights can't be moved out of courts governed by Article III."
"Sur veying English cases and considering the remedy these suits provided, the Court concluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were “quin tessentially suits at common law.”","The Court decided that fraud cases were ""fundamentally suits at common law."
"When a debtor files for bankruptcy, it “creates an estate” that includes virtually all the debtor’s assets.","When a debtor goes bankrupt, they create an estate including most of their assets."

the distribution of the estate’s assets and present it to the bankruptcy court for approval.",The debtor must create a plan for how to distribute the estate's assets and get court approval.
Section 1123(b) addresses the kinds of provisions that may be included in a Chapter 11 plan.,"A Chapter 11 plan can include certain types of provisions, which are addressed in Section 1123(b)."
"Because provisions like the Sackler discharge are not expressly prohibited, they reason, paragraph (6) necessarily permits them.","Because provisions like the Sackler discharge aren't explicitly forbidden, they argue, paragraph (6) therefore allows them."
"While paragraph (6) doubtlessly confers additional author  ities on a bankruptcy court, it cannot be read under the canon of  ejusdem generis to endow a bankruptcy court with the “radically dif  ferent” power to discharge the debts of a nondebtor without the con  sent of affected claimants.","Paragraph 6 gives more powers to a bankruptcy court, but it can't be used to allow a court to cancel a person who isn't in debt's debts without their agreement."
"If a federal official accepts a bribe for an official act, federal bribery law provides for a 15-year maximum prison sentence.",A government official who is paid to do something they should do anyway can be sent to prison for up to 15 years.
"In 1984, Congress passed and President Reagan signed a law now codified at 18 U. S. C. §666 that, as relevant here, extended the gratuities prohibition in §201(c) to most state and local officials.","In 1984, Congress passed a law that made it illegal for most state and local officials to take bribes."
"As amended, the text of §666 now closely resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b), and makes it a crime for most state and local officials to “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value” “intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with” any official business or transaction worth $5,000 or more.",It's now a crime for most state and local officials to corruptly ask for or take money for official work.
The dividing line between §201(b)’s bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that bribery requires an official to have a corrupt state of mind and to accept (or agree to accept) a payment intending to be influenced in an official act.,Bribery requires an official to have a corrupt intention and accept money to influence their work.
"The Government says that the statute would not cover
“innocuous” or “obviously benign” gratuities, but the Government does
not identify any remotely clear lines separating such a gratuity from a
criminal gratuity.","The Government says it won't cover small or harmless gifts, but it doesn't explain where to draw the line."
"Under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, an executive of ficer’s decision “to admit or to exclude an alien” “is final and conclu sive,”.",An executive officer's decision on whether to let a foreigner into the country is always final.
"Asencio-Cordero cannot invoke the exception himself, thus Muñoz must assert that the denial of her husband’s visa violated her consti tutional rights, thereby enabling judicial review.",Muñoz had to say that denying her husband's visa broke Asencio-Cordero's constitutional rights.
"Thus in United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U. S. 537, the Court reaffirmed, in the case of a noncitizen spouse who was denied admission for confidential security reasons, the longstanding principle “that the United States can, as a matter of public policy . . . forbid aliens or classes of aliens from coming within [its] borders,” and “[n]o limits can be put by the courts upon” that power.","The Court reaffirmed that the US can keep out anyone who might be a threat to its security, and judges cannot limit this power."
"The District Court granted summary judgment to the State De partment, but the Ninth Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that Muñoz had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in her hus band’s visa application.","The court initially ruled in favor of the government, but it was later overturned by a higher court which said Muñoz had a right to be involved in her husband's visa application."
" Thus in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, the Court held that a novel “sentencing enhancement” was unconstitutional because it violated the rule that only a jury may find “facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is ex posed.”",The Court said in Apprendi v. New Jersey that a jury must decide facts that lead to harsher prison sentences.
But a sentencing procedure followed by a few States hardly represents “convincing” proof that our precedents have mistaken the original meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.,A sentencing procedure in some states doesn't prove we got the original meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments wrong.
