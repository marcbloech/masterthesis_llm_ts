"To determine whether Corner Post’s APA claim is timely, the Court must interpret §2401(a), which provides that civil actions against the United States “shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.”","To decide if Corner Post’s APA claim is on time, the Court needs to understand §2401(a). This section says that lawsuits against the United States must be filed within six years after the right to sue starts."
"While the Board argues that §2401(a) should not be interpreted to adopt a “challenger-by-challenger” approach, the standard accrual rule that §2401(a) exemplifies is plaintiff specific.","The Board argues that §2401(a) should not use a ""challenger-by-challenger"" method, but the standard accrual rule in §2401(a) is specific to the plaintiff."
"Importantly, contemporaneous dictionaries also explained that a cause of action accrues ""on [the] date that damage is sustained and not [the] date when causes are set in motion which ultimately produce injury.""","Importantly, dictionaries from that time said a cause of action starts on the date damage happens, not when the events leading to the damage begin."

Statutes of limitations ‘require plaintiffs to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims’; statutes of repose reflect a ‘legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.’,"Statutes of limitations require people to quickly pursue their known claims. Statutes of repose mean that a defendant should be free from liability after a set time decided by law."
"The Board’s interpretation would thereby decouple the statute of limitations from any injury ‘such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit’—for some, but not all, suits governed by §2401(a).","The Board's interpretation would separate the time limit from any injury, making it start before a person can file a suit, but only for some suits under §2401(a)."
The Board’s arguments to the contrary lack merit.,"The Board's counterarguments are not strong."
Departing from the traditional rule is particularly inappropriate here because contemporaneous statutes demonstrate that Congress in 1948 knew how to create a limitations period that begins with the defendant’s action instead of the plaintiff’s injury.,Leaving the traditional rule is not right here because laws from 1948 show that Congress knew how to start the time limit with the defendant's action instead of the plaintiff's injury.
"While §702 equips injured parties with a cause of action, §704 limits the agency actions that are subject to judicial review.",§702 allows injured people to take legal action. §704 limits which agency actions can be reviewed by a court.

But that conclusion would rest on a serious misunderstanding of First Amendment precedent and principle.,But that conclusion would be a serious misunderstanding of First Amendment rules and ideas.
That controversy sounds a familiar note: We have repeatedly faced the question whether ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the First Amendment.,We have often asked if making someone give a place for another's views affects the First Amendment.
"The Court has repeatedly held that ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the First Amendment if, though only if, the regulated party is engaged in its own expressive activity, which the mandated access would alter or disrupt.",The Court has said many times that forcing someone to host another person's views affects the First Amendment only if the person being forced is already sharing their own views and the forced views would change or interrupt their own message.
"From that slew of individual cases, three general points emerge.","From those many individual cases, three main points appear."

in compiling and curating others’ speech into an expressive product of
its own is directed to accommodate messages it would prefer to exclude.","The First Amendment protects an entity that compiles and curates others' speech into its own product, even if it prefers to exclude some messages."

"NetChoice contends that the Florida and Texas statutes facially violate the First Amendment, meaning that they cannot be applied to anyone at any time under any circumstances without violating the Constitution","NetChoice argues that the Florida and Texas laws always violate the First Amendment and cannot be applied to anyone at any time without breaking the Constitution."

The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.,The President is completely protected from criminal charges for actions within his exclusive constitutional power.

"We conclude that under our constitutional structure of
separated powers, the nature of Presidential power re-
quires that a former President have some immunity from
criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in
office.",We conclude that a former President needs some protection from criminal charges for official acts done while in office because of our separated powers system.
"Following the analysis set forth in Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, and Tull v. United States, 481 U.

"Because provisions like the Sackler discharge are not expressly prohibited, they reason, paragraph (6) necessarily permits them.","Because provisions like the Sackler discharge are not clearly banned, they believe paragraph (6) must allow them."
"While paragraph (6) doubtlessly confers additional author  ities on a bankruptcy court, it cannot be read under the canon of  ejusdem generis to endow a bankruptcy court with the “radically dif  ferent” power to discharge the debts of a nondebtor without the con  sent of affected claimants.","Paragraph (6) gives a bankruptcy court extra powers, but it does not allow the court to cancel a nondebtor's debts without consent from those affected."

The law extended the ban on gratuities to most state and local officials."
"As amended, the text of §666 now closely resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b), and makes it a crime for most state and local officials to “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value” “intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with” any official business or transaction worth $5,000 or more.","The amended text of §666 is similar to the bribery law for federal officials, §201(b). It makes it a crime for most state and local officials to corruptly ask for, accept, or agree to accept anything of value to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any official business worth $5,000 or more."
The dividing line between §201(b)’s bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that bribery requires an official to have a corrupt state of mind and to accept (or agree to accept) a payment intending to be influenced in an official act.,Bribery means an official must be corrupt and accept a payment intending to be influenced in an official act. Gratuities do not require this corrupt intent.

"Thus in United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U. S. 537, the Court reaffirmed, in the case of a noncitizen spouse who was denied admission for confidential security reasons, the longstanding principle “that the United States can, as a matter of public policy . . . forbid aliens or classes of aliens from coming within [its] borders,” and “[n]o limits can be put by the courts upon” that power.","In the case United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, the Court decided that the U.S. can stop noncitizens from entering the country for security reasons. The Court also said that there are no limits on this power."
"The District Court granted summary judgment to the State De partment, but the Ninth Circuit vacated the judgment, holding that Muñoz had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in her hus band’s visa application.","The District Court ruled in favor of the State Department. However, the Ninth Circuit overturned this decision, stating that Muñoz had a protected liberty interest in her husband’s visa application."
" Thus in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, the Court held that a novel “sentencing enhancement” was unconstitutional because it violated the rule that only a jury may find “facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is ex posed.”","In Apprendi v. New Jersey, the Court decided that a new sentencing enhancement was unconstitutional because only a jury can find facts that increase the penalties for a criminal defendant."
